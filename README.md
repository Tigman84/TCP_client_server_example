# TCP Client-Server Communication in Python

This repository contains a simple example of a TCP client-server communication implementation in Python using sockets. The code demonstrates a basic interaction where the client sends a message to the server, and the server responds.

## Files Included

- `server.py`: The Python script for the TCP server.
- `client.py`: The Python script for the TCP client.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tigman84/TCP_client_server_example.git
    cd TCP_client_server_example
    ```

2. Run the server:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

3. Open a new terminal and run the client:

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

    The client will send a message to the server, and you'll see the server's response.

## Configuration

- The server and client are configured to communicate on `localhost` and port `12345` by default. You can modify these values in the code if needed.
